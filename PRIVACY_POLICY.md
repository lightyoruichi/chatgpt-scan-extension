# Privacy Policy: AI Search Revealer

**Effective Date:** December 20, 2025  
**Developer:** MIMR Growth Lab

At **MIMR Growth Lab**, we take your privacy seriously. The **AI Search Revealer** Chrome extension is designed with a "Local-First" philosophy. This privacy policy explains what data we handle and, more importantly, what we **do not** do with your information.

---

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
**AI Search Revealer DOES NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data.** 

The extension works by locally intercepting certain network requests on supported AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini) to reveal hidden search queries used by the model. 

- **No Remote Storage**: All processing happens entirely within your browser's local memory.
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: We do not use any analytics, tracking pixels, or third-party cookies.
- **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**: The extension never accesses your name, email, account details, or chat history with the AI providers.

## 2. Local Processing (Network Interception)
To provide its core functionality, the extension intercepts specific API responses from supported AI sites to extract search queries. 
- These queries are displayed to you in a local UI overlay.
- This data is **ephemeral** and is destroyed as soon as the tab is closed or the page is refreshed (unless manually copied by you).

## 3. Third-Party Services
While the extension runs on third-party AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini), it does not share any data with them. Your interactions with those platforms are governed by their respective privacy policies.

## 4. Permissions Disclosure
To function correctly, AI Search Revealer requires the following permissions:
- `storage`: To save your local preferences (e.g., if you've closed the overlay).
- `clipboardWrite`: To allow you to click and copy search queries to your clipboard.
- `contextMenus`: To provide quick-access search and explanation tools when you highlight text.
- `host_permissions`: Limited strictly to `chatgpt.com`, `claude.ai`, `perplexity.ai`, and `gemini.google.com` to allow for network interception.

## 5. Security
Because we do not transmit data over the network, your information remains as secure as your own local computer and browser. We use modern web standards and "Single Purpose" architecture to ensure there are no hidden background processes.

## 6. Your Rights
Since no data is collected or stored by us, there is no data to delete or request access to. You can completely remove the extension and its local settings at any time by uninstalling it from Chrome.
